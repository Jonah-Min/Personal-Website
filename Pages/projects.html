				Using Riot Game's API I created my very own Match History.
				It was done while I was at a Sys Admin conference in Washington D.C. during my
				free time. This was the first time I was working with Django, the python web framework,
				and the design and layout are all done by hand.

				I planned on making my own personal website and also to learn Angular.js, so I decided to kill two birds
				with one stone! I have a very strong interest in UI/UX/Web Design, which is also why I'm minoring in Art,
				and so I decided that this would be a great way to learn about Angular while also practicing my design 
				skills.
