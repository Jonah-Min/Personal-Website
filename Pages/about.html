				<span id='text1'>Hello! My name is Jonah Min and I am a second year Computer Science major at 
					Northeastern University. I love what I do and I've been trying my hardest to learn as much 
					about Computer Science as I can since my second year in High School. I am also pursuing
					a Minor in Art so I can exercise my creative mind while challening my logical mind.

					I have a variety of hobbies including Drawing, Fishing, Calligraphy, Video Games, and Piano.
					I also enjoy coding when I have time and learning new technologies while making fun apps. You
					can find the things I've made and worked on in the Projects tab!

					Fun facts! I've travelled to Korea every other year of my life and am semi-fluent in the

					first year, and I have served Ice Cream to a famous professional baseball player!
